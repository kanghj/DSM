A short writeup describing how to update the models inferred by DSM when new traces become available. This update is done incrementally, without incurring the cost of retraining the model with the entire dataset

* Data_flow_sensitive_execution_traces.pdf

When collecting traces from real-world usage where there may be multiple instances of the class, the traces may get mixed together, preventing successful inference.
This writeup describes how we worked with execution traces collected from an Android application using Droidmon to instrument the app.
